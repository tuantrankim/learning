Grant all persmission on a specific database
```
The user needs access to the database, obviously:

GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE my_db TO my_user;
And (at least) the USAGE privilege on the schema:

GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO my_user;
Then, all permissions for all tables (requires Postgres 9.0 or later):

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO my_user;
And don't forget sequences (if any):

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO my_user;

connect to database

psql -U my_user -h 127.0.0.1 -d database_name

# Reset Forgotten Password For postgres User 

http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-reset-password/

```
PostgreSQL uses the  pg_hba.conf configuration file that is stored in the database data 
directory to control the client authentication. HBA means host-based authentication. 
To reset the password for the postgres user, 
you need to modify some parameters in this configuration file.

Step 1. Backup the pg_dba.conf

Step 2. This step ensures that you can log into PostgreSQL database server without using the password.
Edit the pg_dba.conf file by adding the following line as the first line after the comment lines. 
The comment line starts with the # sign.

local  all   all   trust

PostgreSQL on Windows OS

host    all              postgres           127.0.0.1/32            trust

Step 3. Restart PostgreSQL server e.g., in Linux, you use the following command:
>sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql restart

Step 4. Connect to PostgreSQL database server and change the password of the postgres user.
>ALTER USER postgres with password 'very_secure_password';

Step 5. Restore the pg_db.conf file and restart the server, and connect to the PostgreSQL database server with new password.
>sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql restart

```
## pgAdmin 3 (default superuser/password)
```
Name: localhost
Host: 127.0.0.1
Port: 5432
Maintenance DB: postgres
Username: postgres
Password: postgres
```

## ROLE -http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-roles/
```
CREATE ROLE role_name;

SELECT
   rolname
FROM
   pg_roles;
```

#### The following statement creates a role that has login privilege, password, and valid date.

>CREATE ROLE doe WITH PASSWORD 'pgSecpas1970' VALID UNTIL '2020-01-01';

#### The following statement creates a role that has superuser status, which means this role can bypass all authorization checks:

>CREATE ROLE bigboss SUPERUSER;

#### If you want a role to have database creation privilege, you use the following statement:

>CREATE ROLE admin CREATEDB;

#### Use the following statement to create a role that has creation privilege:

>CREATE ROLE security CREATEROLE;

#### Group role

```
-By convention, a group role does not have LOGIN privilege.

-To create a group role, you use the CREATE ROLE statement as follows:

>CREATE ROLE group_role;

For example, the following statement creates sales group role:

>CREATE ROLE sales;
Now, you can add a user role to a group role by using the GRANT statement:

>GRANT group_role to user_role;
For example, to add the doe user role to the sales group role, you use the following statement:

>GRANT sales TO doe;
To remove a user role from a group role, you use REVOKE statement:

>REVOKE group_role FROM user_role;
For example, to remove doe user role from the sales group role, you use the following statement:

>REVOKE sales FROM doe;
```

#### See the following example:
```
CREATE ROLE doe LOGIN INHERIT;
CREATE ROLE sales NOINHERIT;
CREATE ROLE marketing NOINHERIT;
GRANT sales to doe;
GRANT marketing to sales;

After executing the following statement:

>SET ROLE sales;

You will have only privileges granted to sales, not the ones that granted to doe.

And after executing the following statement:

>SET ROLE marketing;

You only have privileges granted to marketing, not the ones that granted to admin and doe.

To restore the original privilege, you can use the following statement:

>RESET ROLE;

Notice that only privileges on the database object are inheritable. The LOGIN, SUPERUSER, CREATEROLE, and CREATEDB are the special role that cannot be inherited as an ordinary privilege.

Removing roles

You can use the DROP ROLE statement to remove a group role or user role.

>DROP ROLE role_name;

```

# Backup Database

>pg_dump -U username -W -F t database_name > c:\backup_file.tar

e.g.:
```
C:\>cd C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.2\bin
pg_dump -U postgres -W -F t dvdrental > c:\pgbackup\dvdrental.tar

-U postgres:  specifies the user to connect to PostgreSQL database server. We used postgres in this example.

-W:  forces pg_dump to prompt for the password before connecting to the PostgreSQL database server. After you hit enter, pg_dump will prompt for the password of postgres user.

-F : specifies the output file format that can be one of the following:

c: custom-format archive file format
d: directory-format archive
t:tar
p: plain text SQL script file).
Because we want the output file to be a tar-format archive file, we use  -F t in this example.

dvdrental: is the name of the database that we want to back

> c:\pgbackup\dvdrental.tar is the output backup file path.

```

#### How to backup all databases

```
>pg_dumpall -U postgres > c:\pgbackup\all.sql
```

#### How to backup database object definitions

```
To backup all objects in all databases, including roles, tablespaces, databases, schemas, tables, indexes, triggers, functions, constraints, views, ownerships and privileges, you use the following command:

>pg_dumpall --schema-only > c:\pgdump\definitiononly.sql

If you want to backup role definition only, use the following command:

>pg_dumpall --roles-only > c:\pgdump\allroles.sql

If you want to backup tablespaces definition, use the following command:

>pg_dumpall --tablespaces-only > c:\pgdump\allroles.sql
```

# Restore Database

```
How to restore databases using psql
The psqlutility allows you to restore SQL script file generated by the pg_dump,  pg_dumpall 
or any other tools that generates compatible backed up files. By using the psql tool, 
you have to execute the entire script.

To restore a full backup and ignore any error occurred during the restoration process, 
you use the following command:

>psql -U username -f backupfile.sql

If you want to stop restoring database in case an error occurs, you use the following command:

>psql -U username --set ON_ERROR_STOP=on -f backupfile
Notice that we have added an additional option --set ON_ERROR_STOP=on

If you backup specific database objects in a particular database, 
you can restore them using the following command:

>psql -U username -d database_name -f objects.sql
```

#### How to restore databases using pg_restore
```
Besides psqltool, you can use  pg_restore program to restore databases backed up by the  pg_dump or pg_dumpalltools.
With  pg_restore program, you have various options for restoration databases, for example:

The  pg_restore allows you to perform parallel restores using the  -j option to specify the number of threads for restoration. Each thread restores a separate table simultaneously, which speeds up the process dramatically. Currently, the  pg_restore support this option for the only custom file format.
The  pg_restore enables you to restore specific database objects in a backup file that contains the full database.
The  pg_restore can take a database backed up in the older version and restore it in the newer version.
Letâ€™s create a new database named newdvdrentalfor practicing with the pg_restore tool.

>CREATE DATABASE newdvdrental;

You can restore the dvdrentaldatabase in tarfile format generated by the  pg_dump tool in the PostgreSQL backup database tutorial using the following command:

>pg_restore --dbname=newdvdrental --verbose c:\pgbackup\dvdrental.tar

If you restore the database, which is the same as the one that you backed up, you can use the following command:

>pg_restore --dbname=dvdrental --create --verbose c:\pgbackup\dvdrental.tar

As PostgreSQL 9.2, you can use the  --section option to restore table structure only. This allows you to use the new database as the template for creating other databases.

First, you can create a new database named dvdrental_tpl.

>CREATE DATABASE dvdrental_tpl;

Second, we can restore table structure only from the dvdrental.tar backup file by using the following command:

>pg_restore --dbname=dvdrental_tpl --section=pre-data  c:\pgbackup\dvdrental.tar

PostgreSQL commands
Access the PostgreSQL server from psql with a specific user:

psql -U [username];
For example, the following command uses the postgres user to access the PostgreSQL database server:

psql -U postgres
Connect to a specific database:

For example, the following command connects to the dvdrental database:

\c dvdrental;
You are now connected to database "dvdrental" as user "postgres".
To quit the psql:

\q
List all databases in the PostgreSQL database server

\l
List all schemas:

\dn
